1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Ans.The two values of the Boolean data type are True and False. Written as it is first letter in uppercase (True,False).

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Ans. AND, OR, NOT.

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
   values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Ans.AND operator:
    True-True = True
    False-False = Fasle
    True-False = Fasle
    False-True = Fasle.
    
    OR operator:
    False-False = Fasle
    True-True = True
    True-False = True
    False-True = True.
    
    NOT operator:
    True = False
    False = True.
    
    
    
4. What are the values of the following expressions?
   (5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
   not (5 > 4)
  (5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
  not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
  (True and True) and (True == False)
  (not False) or (not True).
Ans.
    (5 > 4) and (3 == 5)               --False
    not (5 > 4)                        --False  
    (5 > 4) or (3 == 5)                --True
    not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))          --False
    (True and True) and (True == False)--False
    (not False) or (not True)          --True.


5. What are the six comparison operators?
Ans.Equal to (==)
    Not equal to (!=)
    Greater than (>)
    Less than (<)
    Greater than or equal to (>=)
    Less than or equal to (<=).

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?
   Describe a condition and when you would use one.
Ans.Equal to Operator (==): The equal to operator is used to compare if two values are equal.
    The equal to operator (==) is used for comparison.
    Equal to operator: x == y compares if the value of x is equal to the value of y.
    Assignment Operator (=): The assignment operator is used to assign a value to a variable.
    The assignment operator (=) is used for assigning values to variables.
    Assignment operator: x = 5 assigns the value 5 to the variable x.

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
 spam = 0
 if spam == 10:
     print('eggs')
 if spam > 5:
     print('bacon')
 else:
    print('ham')
    print('spam')
    print('spam')

Ans.spam = 0
 if spam == 10:
     print('eggs')   #--block1
 if spam > 5:
     print('bacon')  #--block2
 else:
    print('ham')     #--block3
    print('spam')
    print('spam')
    Block 1: It contains the print('eggs') statement. This block is executed if the condition spam == 10 is True.
    Block 2: It contains the print('bacon') statement. This block is executed if the condition spam > 5 is True.
    Block 3: It contains the print('ham'), print('spam'), and print('spam') statements.This block is executed if the condition spam>5 is         False.

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
   Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
Ans.
   spam = input("Enter data: ")

if spam == "1":
    print("Hello")
elif spam == "2":
    print("Howdy")
else:
    print("Greetings!")
    

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
Ans.I can press the "Ctrl + C" keys on my keyboard.
    This combination sends a Keyboard Interrupt signal to the program, which typically causes it to terminate and exit the loop. 

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Ans.The "break" statement is used to exit the current loop and continue with the next statement outside the loop.
    It terminates the loop entirely.
    The "continue" statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Ans.range(10):This specifies a range that starts from 0 and ends at 10 (exclusive). It increments by 1.it generates a sequence of numbers       from 0 to 9.
    
    range(0, 10):This the start value as 0, and the end value as 10 (exclusive).It also increments by 1.The result is the same as range(10).
    
    range(0, 10, 1):The start value as 0, the end value as 10 (exclusive), and the step value as 1. It increments by 1 in each iteration.       the result is the same as the previous two examples.if step value is 2 its increments by 2 in each iteratinon.

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
    program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Ans.
# Using a for loop
for num in range(1, 11):
    print(num)
    
# Using a while loop
num = 1
while num <= 10:
    print(num)
    num += 1


13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?
Ans.
   import spam
   spam.bacon()
